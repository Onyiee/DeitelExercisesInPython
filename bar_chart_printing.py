# 5.16 (Bar Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display
# graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. For each
# number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks.
# For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******. Display the bars of asterisks after
# you read all five numbers.
